# LinkedIn-Authentication-Django

When a user clicks the "Log in with LinkedIn" button, they are redirected to the LinkedIn authentication page. On that page, the user will be asked to grant permission to your application to access their LinkedIn profile information.

If the user grants permission, LinkedIn will redirect them back to your application's LinkedIn callback URL with an authorization code. Your application will then exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a request to the LinkedIn API. This access token can be used to make subsequent API requests on behalf of the user.

The LinkedIn backend in Django then uses the access token to fetch the user's LinkedIn profile information from the LinkedIn API. If the user already exists in your Django database, the backend will retrieve their information and log them in. If the user does not exist in your database, the backend will create a new user object and log them in.

Once the user is logged in, they can access the protected areas of your application like any other authenticated user.
